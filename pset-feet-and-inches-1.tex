  \item A measurement is 4 feet 10 inches. How many inches is this? 
  \spacing

  \item A measurement is 3 yards 1 foot 7 inches. How many inches is this? 
  \spacing

  \item Write 78$''$ in feet and inches. 
  \spacing

  \item A part is to be 5$''$ wide. To the nearest tenth of a foot, what is this dimension in decimal feet? 
  \spacing

  \item A part is to be 1$'$ 6$''$ long. What is this dimension in decimal feet? 
  \spacing

  \item A piece of material 12$'$ 9$''$ long is to be cut into 9 equal pieces. How long will each piece be, ignoring the width of the cut?
  \spacing

  \item Write in decimal feet to the nearest hundredth of a foot 2$'$ 7$\frac{3}{4}$ inches. 
  \spacing

  \item Write in decimal feet to the nearest hundredth of a foot 3$'$ 9$\frac{5}{8}$ inches. 
  \spacing

  \item Write in decimal feet to the nearest hundredth of a foot 1$'$ 4$\frac{3}{16}$ inches. 
  \spacing

  \item Write in inches to the nearest quarter inch 2.227 feet. 
  \spacing

  \item Write in feet and inches to the nearest eighth of an inch 3.135 feet. 
  \spacing

  \item Write in feet and inches to the nearest sixteenth of an inch 3 feet 1.79 inches. 
  \spacing

  \item Write in feet and inches to the nearest sixteenth of an inch 50.681 inches. 
  \spacing

  \item Ten pieces are to be cut from half-inch bar stock. Each of the ten is to be 1$'$ 2$\frac{1}{4}$ inches long. Ignoring the width of the cut, write in feet and inches rounded up to the nearest inch the minimum length of bar stock required. 
  \spacing

  \item A strip of aluminum 12$'$ 6$''$ long is to be cut into eleven equal pieces. What is the length of each piece in feet and inches to the nearest sixteenth of an inch? 
  \spacing

  \item An assembly requires three sections of bar stock measuring 2$'$ 6$''$, 1$'$ 10$''$, and 4$'$ 9$''$ long. These are to be cut from a 10$'$ piece. Each cut wastes 0.125 inches of material. In feet and inches rounded down to the nearest inch, how much will be left from the 10$'$ piece?
